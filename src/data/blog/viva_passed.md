I am beyond thrilled to share the news that I have officially passed my PhD viva with minor correction! After years of research, writing, and countless moments of perseverance, I can finally say that I am Dr. Dong Qichen. It is surreal, exciting, and, in many ways, a moment of deep reflection. For those who may not know, the PhD viva is the oral examination that marks the culmination of a doctoral journey. It is the moment where you defend your research and demonstrate your expertise in your field. 

It has been an incredible journey filled with highs and lows, breakthroughs and challenges, and the ever-present interplay of curiosity and persistence. Walking into my viva, I was met with a combination of excitement and anxiety. Would they ask me the questions I had rehearsed answers for? Would I be able to respond confidently to unexpected challenges? As the discussion began, I found myself settling into the familiar territory of my research, and a wave of confidence took over. My examiners, Prof. David Colling and Dr. Conor Fitzpatrick asked thoughtful, challenging questions, but I realised that no one knew my research better than I did. However, as an experimentalist, I am getting rusty on the Quantum Field theory, and I realize how essential it is to stay grounded in both theoretical and experimental aspects of particle physics. While my work often involves collecting and analysing data, understanding the theoretical underpinnings ensures that I am asking the right questions and interpreting results within the broader context of our understanding of the universe.

I could not have done this alone. My deepest gratitude goes to my supervisor, Prof. Terry Wyatt FRS, for his guidance, patience, and unwavering support throughout this journey. To my colleagues, friends, and family who believed in me even when I struggled to believe in myself, thank you for standing by my side. This marks the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. With my PhD behind me, I am looking forward to my next adventure as a postdoc at Oxford. I am excited to continue learning, exploring, and contributing to my field. For anyone out there currently on their PhD journey, know that your efforts are worth it. The challenges are immense, but so is the reward. Trust in your work, seek support when you need it, and celebrate each small victory along the way. Thank you to everyone who has been part of this incredible journey.
