I'm thrilled to announce the publication of my first ATLAS paper as the lead author, titled "Improved reconstruction of highly boosted $\tau$-lepton pairs in the $\tau\tau\to (\mu\nu_\mu\mu_\tau) (\mathrm{hadrons} + \nu_\tau)$ decay channels with the ATLAS detector" has been submitted to EPJC, now available on arXiv ([2412.14937](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14937))!

This work introduces a novel method for reconstructing and identifying $\tau$-lepton pairs produced with high momentum (boost) in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Specifically, it focuses on events where one $\tau$-lepton decays into a muon and neutrinos ($\tau_\mu$), and the other decays into hadrons and a neutrino ($\tau_\mathrm{had}$). By refining the reconstruction process - particularly by excluding muon information from the $\tau_\mathrm{had}$ candidate - we've achieved a significant improvement in efficiency, aligning it with expectations for isolated $\tau_\mathrm{had}$ candidates.

To validate our approach, we analyzed data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb${}^{-1}$ from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS detector. We selected a sample of highly boosted $Z\to\tau_\mu\tau_\mathrm{had}$ candidates and observed excellent agreement between our data and simulation predictions. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing signal sensitivity for boosted $\tau_\mu\tau_\mathrm{had}$ channels within the ATLAS experiment.

This advancement holds promise for future analyses involving $\tau$-leptons, particularly in searches for new physics phenomena where boosted $\tau$-lepton pairs are prevalent. I'm grateful for the support and collaboration of my colleagues at ATLAS and look forward to contributing further to our understanding of particle physics.
