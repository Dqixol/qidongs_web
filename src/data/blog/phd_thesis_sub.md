I am thrilled to announce that I have submitted my PhD thesis, entitled **"Novel Boosted lep-had di-tau Reconstruction Techniques for TeV-Scale Graviton Search in HH->bbττ Channel with the ATLAS Detector."**

This journey has been an incredible experience, and I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my supervisor, **Prof. Terry Wyatt FRS**, for his invaluable guidance, support, and patience throughout this process. Your insights and encouragement have significantly shaped my research and academic growth.

I would also like to extend my thanks to **The University of Manchester** and the **ATLAS collaboration at CERN**. It has been an honor to work alongside some of the best particle physicists and contribute to our understanding of the universe.

## Research Highlights

During my PhD, I proposed, developed, and validated two novel particle reconstruction techniques that identified previously unobserved high-energy collision events. These techniques are now adopted by the ATLAS collaboration as standard reconstruction methods for real-time data-taking. Using the new technique, I am leading a search for ultra-heavy particles, achieving upper limits on their production rate that are ten times more stringent than previous measurements in the same channel.

Thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey!

## Looking Ahead

As I look to the future, I am excited about the opportunities that await me, whether in academia or industry.
