What a year. Here’s what I worked on in 2025.

## Highlights

- **Before April:** Finished a boosted di-$\tau_\mathrm{had}$ trigger for ATLAS for the 2025 LHC run - spent a lot of time optimising for those tight, collimated taus for real-time online data taking.  
- **April:** Moved to CERN and started my postdoc with Oxford - big life change, very exciting.  
- **Apr–Oct:** Funded by the ATLAS Software Development Grant. The project gained recognition in ATLAS for "Athena ML inference unification" - we brought FTag and Tau together into a cleaner, maintainable SaltModel-based Athena flow and set up a shared ONNX inference workflow. Felt great to see the software work actually make life easier for others. Elected FTAG software group Reco & Inference contact at the end - happy to help push the software side forward. 
- **September:** Elected Run 2 + partial Run 3 boosted $H\to\tau_\mathrm{had}\tau_\mathrm{had}$ analysis contact - more coordination, more meetings, more coffee.  
- **October (PIC2025, Egypt):** Gave an ATLAS talk on BSM Higgs searches - covered the Higgs-sector overview and highlighted the $H\to aa\to 4\tau$ search I’m involved with. 
- **December:** Accepted an Eric & Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship at Oxford (starts mid 2026). I’ll be working on AI for di-Higgs searches - the HL-LHC flagship project. Dreams do come true. 🎉

## Notes

This year was a mash-up of code, coordination, and conferences — plus a proper relocation. I learned a ton about production-level ML in Athena, leaned into service roles that force you to be organised (and diplomatic), and got to talk physics in front of a proper audience at PIC. Moving to CERN made the whole thing feel real in a way I’d been waiting for.

Big thanks to collaborators, mentors, and everyone who answered a late-night MatterMost thread. If 2025 had a soundtrack, it would be equal parts Python scripts, meeting reminders, and airport announcements.

## Looking forward

2026’s already looking shiny: AI for di-Higgs at Oxford, more software unification for ATLAS, and deeper work on boosted tau signatures. But first - mince pies, a little break, and a proper Christmas tree. 🌟
